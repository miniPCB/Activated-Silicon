## `EPSA -- Electrical Parts Stress Analysis`

`Title: Common Emitter Amplifier (04B-005, Rev A1-00) Interface: 5-pin Design
Type: Fundamental, Common topology`

1)  `Scope and Objectives`
- `Identify applied electrical/thermal stresses vs. part ratings for all parts
  in Q1-based common-emitter amplifier.`
- `Establish derating criteria and pass/fail thresholds for worst-case operating
  conditions.`
- `Provide measurement plan to validate stresses at TP1-TP12.`
1)  `Operating and Environmental Assumptions (update when actuals are known)`
- `Supply V+ range: 9 V to 15 V (assumed). Nominal: 12 V.`
- `Load: AC-coupled via C6 to external load ≥ 10 k Ohm  unless otherwise specified.`
- `Ambient temperature Ta: -40  deg C to +85  deg C; board-level ΔT due to self-heating
  considered.`
- `Altitude: up to 3 km (convection cooling); no forced airflow assumed.`
- `Signal: Audio/low-frequency band (20 Hz-20 kHz) assumed based on coupling
  caps C2/C6; duty cycle 100%.`
- `Component technologies (assumed):`
  - `Resistors: 1/4 W thick-film, 200 V rating unless otherwise specified.`
  - `Capacitors: C1/C3/C4/C5/C6 electrolytic or tantalum (voltage rating ≥ 2x
    V+max recommended); C2 film/electrolytic per size.`
  - `Q1: Small-signal BJT (TO-92/SOT-223 class) with Vceo ≥ 40 V, Ic ≥ 100 mA,
    Pd per package.`
  - `Pots (R7, R9): carbon film, 0.25 W.`
  - `Connectors: rated ≥ V+ and expected I.`
1)  `Topology Summary (from netlist)`
- `Q1 (BJT): B=N$5, C=N$9, E=N$6.`
- `Collector load: R4 from V+ to N$9; R10 from N$9 to N$11 (to J2-1) forms a
  tap/output network; C6 couples N$9 to OUT (P1-5).`
- `Base network: C2 couples IN (P1-4) to N$5; bias via R1 (to V+), R2
  (adjustable network pins S/A/E at N$5,N$3,N$5), R7 pot to V+, R8 from N$9 to
  N$1, etc. Exact bias uses R1/R2/R7/R8 combination.`
- `Emitter network: E=N$6 to J1-1; R5 between N$13 and N$6; R9 pot between N$4
  and N$13; R6 from N$4 to GND; C4 from N$4 to GND provides AC bypass.`
- `Decoupling: C1, C3 from V+ to GND.`
1)  `Derating Policy (recommended)`
- `Resistors: P_diss ≤ 50% of rated at 85  deg C; voltage ≤ 60% rating.`
- `Capacitors:`
  - `Electrolytic/tantalum: DC voltage ≤ 50% of rating at 85  deg C; ripple current
    ≤ 60% rating; ESR within vendor limits.`
  - `Film/ceramic: DC voltage ≤ 60% rating.`
- `Semiconductors (Q1):`
  - `Pd_junction ≤ 50% of package rating at 85  deg C ambient with ΘJA considered.`
  - `Vce ≤ 60% of Vceo; Ic ≤ 50% of Ic_max; junction temp Tj ≤ 110  deg C (goal).`
- `Adjustable resistors: wiper current ≤ 1/10 rated power path; avoid wiper as
  sole current path for DC unless justified.`
1)  `Stress Calculations -- Methods and Formulas Note: Replace TBD with actual
    values when BOM is available.`
- `Supply decoupling (C1, C3):`
  - `V_stress(C1/C3) ≈ V+_max => select V_rating ≥ 2xV+_max (e.g., ≥ 30 V for 15
    V system).`
  - `Ripple current: Irms ≈ I_load_ripple (measure at TP3 with AC bandwidth).
    Ensure Irms ≤ 0.6xIrated.`
- `Collector resistor (R4):`
  - `Ic ≈ sets by bias; V_R4 = V+ - Vc; P_R4 = V_R4^2 / R4.`
  - `Worst case when Q1 saturated or high Ic: P_R4,WCA = (V+ - Vc,min)^2 /
    R4_min. Ensure ≤ 0.5xPrated.`
- `Emitter network (R5, R9, R6):`
  - `Ve = IE·Re_eff; P_R5 ≈ (IE^2)·R5; P_R9_section ≈ (IE^2)·R9_section.`
  - `If C4 fully bypasses AC at N$4, check ripple current through C4: Irms(C4) ≈
    Ve_ac / Xc4.`
- `Base network (R1, R2, R7, R8):`
  - `Thevenin bias: Vth = V+·(R_down/(R_up+R_down)), Rth = (R_up||R_down)
    including pot settings.`
  - `IB = (Vth - Vbe)/(Rth + (β+1)·Re_unbyp); check wiper current through pot
    segments; P_each = I^2·R.`
- `Coupling caps (C2 input, C6 output):`
  - `DC stress: Vdc(C2) ≈ |Vb_bias - Vin_dc| (nominally near Vb). Vdc(C6) ≈
    |Vc_bias - Vout_dc| (nominally Vc to 0 V). Select rating ≥ 2x expected DC.`
  - `AC stress: Vrms_ac = Iac·Xc; ensure ripple ≤ 0.6xIrated (electrolytics).`
- `Q1 (BJT):`
  - `DC: Ic = β·IB; Vce = Vc - Ve; Pd = Vce·Ic.`
  - `Thermal: Tj = Ta + Pd·ΘJA. Ensure Tj ≤ limit and Pd ≤ 0.5xPrated.`
  - `SOA: Verify (Vce, Ic) within DC SOA at Tmax.`
- `Connectors (J1, J2, P1):`
  - `Voltage stress ≤ 60% of rating; current ≤ 50% of rating; ensure no DC on
    output path (C6 health).`
1)  `Preliminary Stress Summary (template) | Ref | Function | Key Stress |
    Applied (WCA) | Rating | % of Rating | Status | | --- | --- | --- | --- |

    |`
2)  `Test Points and Validation Plan`
- `TP3: V+; verify V+ range and ripple.`
- `TP10 (Vin side) and TP2 (base node): measure Vb, AC amplitude; confirm
  coupling C2 DC isolation.`
- `TP7 (emitter N$6) and TP6/TP8 (emitter network nodes): measure Ve DC and AC
  to compute IE and Re_eff.`
- `TP10/TP11/TP12/TP9/TP5 as available: measure Vc at TP10/TP9, output AC at
  TP12; verify C6 DC block.`
- `Record temperatures on Q1 and high-dissipation resistors; compute Tj and
  margins.`
1)  `Pass/Fail Criteria`
- `All stresses ≤ derating limits in Section 4 over V+, temperature, tolerance,
  β corners.`
- `No DC present at OUT (N$7) exceeding 50 mV in steady state.`
- `Q1 junction temperature margin ≥ 20  deg C to limit at high Ta.`
1)  `Open Items`
- `Populate actual component values and ratings from BOM.`
- `Identify Q1 exact part to confirm ΘJA, Pd, Vceo, β distribution.`
- `Confirm capacitor technologies (C2/C6) and ESR/Irated.`
- `Define actual V+ range and load range to finalize worst-case set.`
